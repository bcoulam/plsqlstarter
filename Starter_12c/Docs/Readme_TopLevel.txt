The simplified version of the "Starter" framework was created for shops that 
want to use or experiment with the framework in a single schema. Security and 
authorization, locking, common messages, and self-discovering dynamic parameters 
were removed. The main features left are auditing, logging and metrics, as well 
as a table to hold table-driven application properties/parameters.

If your shop wants a common PL/SQL application framework to be shared across 
multiple applications found in multiple schemas, you need the full Starter 
Framework. Go to folder plsqlframestart/2.0.

Working on the Simple Starter allowed me to simplify a few things that will find 
their way into Starter 2.1. I just have not done so yet, nor uploaded it.

The full documentation set for Starter is found in the Starter download, as well 
as the framestartdocs/2.0 folder. Please read the Starter_UserGuide.pdf doc in 
that zip file, as it will go a long way to helping you overcome the initial 
learning curve associated with adopting any new framework.
